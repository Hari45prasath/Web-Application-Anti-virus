Web Application Security Antivirus
This project is an advanced security solution designed to protect web applications from various types of security threats, including malware, vulnerabilities, and attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). The web application antivirus scans and monitors web traffic, identifying and neutralizing malicious payloads, providing real-time protection against a range of web-based threats.

Features:
1)Real-Time Scanning: Automatically scans incoming and outgoing data for known malware signatures.
2)Vulnerability Detection: Identifies potential vulnerabilities in the web application, including common attack vectors.
3)Threat Intelligence: Utilizes up-to-date threat databases to detect new and emerging security risks.
4)Detailed Reports: Provides comprehensive logs and reports of detected threats and security incidents.
5)Custom Rules: Allows administrators to configure custom security rules for advanced threat mitigation.
6)API Integration: Easily integrates with other security services via REST APIs.
Technologies Used:
1)Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js for backend
2)React or Angular for frontend
3)Open-source libraries for threat detection and malware analysis
4)Regular updates for virus and threat signature databases
This repository aims to provide a framework that can be extended and integrated into any existing web application to enhance its security and safeguard against common and emerging cyber threats.
